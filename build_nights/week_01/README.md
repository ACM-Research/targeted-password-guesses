## agenda

- introductions
- how ACM Research works
- our problem
- introduction to machine learning
- administrivia
	- Slack
	- GitHub
- introduction to GPT-3

## homework

- Skim through past research
	1. [Fast, Lean, and Accurate: Modeling Password Guessability Using Neural Networks](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/nicolasc/publications/M+-USENIXSec16.pdf)
	2. [Targeted Online Password Guessing: An Underestimated Threat](https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1145/2976749.2978339)
	3. [PassGAN: A Deep Learning Approach for Password Guessing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.00440.pdf)
- Go through GPT-3 docs
	1. [Each section under "GET STARTED"](https://beta.openai.com/docs/introduction)
	2. ["Fine-tuning" section](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning)
		- This section is pretty long and technical; you can just skim it.
