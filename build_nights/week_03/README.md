# build night 3 â€“ 2022-02-21

## agenda

- homework recap
	- How long did it take?
	- Is there anything you're confused about?
- Some team members can keep hunting for the Mate1 dataset.
	- Maybe someone from RaidForums posted it somewhere else, or there's a torrent link floating around.
	- We could easily acquire this dataset by paying for credits on RaidForums, but that would make our research unethical.
- Other team members can experiment with the GPT-3 API.
	- Try fine-tuning a model on [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rusiano/euroleague-alltime-players) consisting of information about Euroleague players.
		- This doesn't have to produce any accurate results, we just want to try out the API on a similar dataset.
		- Since accuracy doesn't matter, please use the cheapest model (Ada).
- If this division of work still feels cramped, someone can start trying to implement a model from a previous research paper.
	- whoever most wants to get their hands dirty with machine learning
	- These are papers from professional researchers, so don't get too down if they're too complicated for us to replicate.
	- If you choose to start taking on this task, know that you can always shift positions if you're no longer feeling it.

## homework

- No more busywork! ðŸ¥³
- Meet with your teammates at least one time outside of this build night before next week.
	- Start advancing the project outside my supervision.
	- But i'll still be interested in what you all find!
- Waiting to hear back from academic advisor.
