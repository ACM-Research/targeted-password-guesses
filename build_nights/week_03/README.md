## homework

- Read or skim over the following papers.
	- [Fast, Lean, and Accurate: Modeling Password Guessability Using Neural Networks](../../resources/Fast_Lean_and.pdf)
	- [Targeted Online Password Guessing: An Underestimated Threat](../../resources/Targeted_Online_Password.pdf)
	- [PassGAN: A Deep Learning Approach for Password Guessing](../../resources/PassGAN_A_Deep.pdf)
