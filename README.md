![](./poster/automating_targeted_password_guessing.pdf)

## about

This is a project for [ACM Research](https://acmutd.co/research) at the University of Texas at Dallas. During the 2022 spring semester, four participants are investigating the use of machine learning in targeted password guessing attacks by refining a GPT-2 model with data from password leaks.

## web demo

To run the web demo, `cd` into the `demo` directory and run `flask run` with env var `FLASK_APP` set to `fsociety`.
