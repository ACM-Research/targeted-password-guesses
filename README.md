# generating targeted password guesses using machine learning

## about

This is a project for ACM Research at UTD. During the 2022 spring semester, four participants aim to build on previous research by refining a GPT-3 model using data from password leaks in order to further investigate the use of machine learning in targeted password guessing attacks.
