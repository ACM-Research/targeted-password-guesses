## introduction

 Imagine trying to hack into your friend's social media account by guessing what password they used to secure it. You do some research to come up with likely guesses â€“ say, you discover they have a dog named "Dixie"and attempt to log in using the password {\tt DixieIsTheBest1}. The problem is that this only works if you have the intuition on how humans choose passwords, and the skills to conduct open-source intelligence gathering.

We refined GPT-3 models on user data from a security breach of the online platform Wattpad in order to generate targeted password guesses \emph{automatically}. This approach combines the vast knowledge of GPT-3's \textbf{1.5 billion parameters} with the personal information of \textbf{1 thousand users}, including usernames, phone numbers, and personal descriptions.
